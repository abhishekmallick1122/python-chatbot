## 🚀 How It Works

- The chatbot uses a dictionary of responses to answer user queries.
- If the user's input matches a key, the bot replies with the corresponding answer.
- If not, it provides a default message.
- The UI is built with Tkinter, featuring a scrollable chat area, input box, send button, and suggestion dropdown.
